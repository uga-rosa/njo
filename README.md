# njo

A small utility to create JSON object written in Nim.
This is inspired by [jpmens/jo](https://github.com/jpmens/jo).

# How to install

You can install via nimble.

```sh
nimble install njo
```

# Difference from original jo

- By default, do NOT allow object key duplication. Therefore, the `-D` option is not available.
